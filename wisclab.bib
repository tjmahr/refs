              group process and Delphi survey consensus methods were used
              to examine content validity and revise the classification

              occupational therapists, and developmental pediatricians with
              expertise in cerebral palsy) was achieved. Interrater
              reliability (k) was 0.55 for children less than 2 years of
              age and 0.75 for children 2 to 12 years of age. The

abstract = {Surveillance registers monitor the prevalence of cerebral palsy 
           and the severity of resulting impairments across time and place. 
           The motor disorders of cerebral palsy can affect children's speech 
           production and limit their intelligibility. We describe the 
           development of a scale to classify children's speech performance for 
           use in cerebral palsy surveillance registers, and its reliability 
           across raters and across time. Speech and language therapists, other 
           healthcare professionals and parents classified the speech of 139 
           children with cerebral palsy (85 boys, 54 girls; mean age 
           6.03 years, SD 1.09) from observation and previous knowledge of the 
           children. Another group of health professionals rated children's 
           speech from information in their medical notes. With the exception 
           of parents, raters reclassified children's speech at least four 
           weeks after their initial classification. Raters were asked to rate 
           how easy the scale was to use and how well the scale described the 
           child's speech production using Likert scales. Inter-rater 
           reliability was moderate to substantial (k>.58 for all comparisons). 
           Test–retest reliability was substantial to almost perfect for all 
           groups (k>.68). Over 74% of raters found the scale easy or very easy 
           to use; 66% of parents and over 70% of health care professionals 
           judged the scale to describe children's speech well or very well. We 
           conclude that the Viking Speech Scale is a reliable tool to describe 
           the speech performance of children with cerebral palsy, which can be 
           applied through direct observation of children or through case note 
           review.},
