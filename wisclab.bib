              occupational therapists, and developmental pediatricians with
              expertise in cerebral palsy) was achieved. Interrater
              reliability (k) was 0.55 for children less than 2 years of
              age and 0.75 for children 2 to 12 years of age. The

  abstract = {Aim We examined three communication ability classification
              paradigms for children with cerebral palsy (CP): the
              Communication Function Classification System (CFCS), the Viking
              Speech Scale (VSS), and the Speech Language Profile
              Groups (SLPG). Questions addressed interjudge reliability,
              whether the VSS and the CFCS captured impairments in speech and
              language, and whether there were differences in speech
              intelligibility among levels within each classification paradigm.
              Method Eighty children (42 males, 38 females) with a range of
              types and severity levels of CP participated (mean age 60mo,
              range 50–72mo [SD 5mo]). Two speech-language pathologists
              classified each child via parent–child interaction samples and
              previous experience with the children for the CFCS and VSS, and
              using quantitative speech and language assessment data for the
              SLPG. Intelligibility scores were obtained using standard
              clinical intelligibility measurement. Results Kappa values were
              0.67 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.55–0.79) for the CFCS,
              0.82 (95\% CI 0.72–0.92) for the VSS, and 0.95
              (95\% CI 0.72–0.92) for the SLPG. Descriptively, reliability
              within levels of each paradigm varied, with the lowest agreement
              occurring within the CFCS at levels II (42\%), III (40\%), and
              IV (61\%). Neither the CFCS nor the VSS were sensitive to
              language impairments captured by the SLPG. Significant
              differences in speech intelligibility were found among levels for
              all classification paradigms. Interpretation Multiple tools are
              necessary to understand speech, language, and communication
              profiles in children with CP. Characterization of abilities at
              all levels of the International Classification of Functioning,
              Disability and Health will advance our understanding of the ways
              that speech, language, and communication abilities present in
              children with CP.},

abstract = {Surveillance registers monitor the prevalence of cerebral palsy
           and the severity of resulting impairments across time and place.
           The motor disorders of cerebral palsy can affect children's speech
           production and limit their intelligibility. We describe the
           development of a scale to classify children's speech performance for
           use in cerebral palsy surveillance registers, and its reliability
           across raters and across time. Speech and language therapists, other
           healthcare professionals and parents classified the speech of 139
           children with cerebral palsy (85 boys, 54 girls; mean age
           6.03 years, SD 1.09) from observation and previous knowledge of the
           children. Another group of health professionals rated children's
           speech from information in their medical notes. With the exception
           of parents, raters reclassified children's speech at least four
           weeks after their initial classification. Raters were asked to rate
           how easy the scale was to use and how well the scale described the
           child's speech production using Likert scales. Inter-rater
           reliability was moderate to substantial (k>.58 for all comparisons).
           Test–retest reliability was substantial to almost perfect for all
           groups (k>.68). Over 74% of raters found the scale easy or very easy
           to use; 66% of parents and over 70% of health care professionals
           judged the scale to describe children's speech well or very well. We
           conclude that the Viking Speech Scale is a reliable tool to describe
           the speech performance of children with cerebral palsy, which can be
           applied through direct observation of children or through case note
           review.},
