  abstract  = {To address the need for a standardized system to classify the
              gross motor function of children with cerebral palsy, the
              authors developed a five-level classification system analogous
              to the staging and grading systems used in medicine. Nominal
              group process and Delphi survey consensus methods were used
              to examine content validity and revise the classification
              system until consensus among 48 experts (physical therapists,
              occupational therapists, and developmental pediatricians with
              expertise in cerebral palsy) was achieved. Interrater
              reliability (k) was 0.55 for children less than 2 years of
              age and 0.75 for children 2 to 12 years of age. The
              classification system has application for clinical practice,
              research, teaching, and administration.},
